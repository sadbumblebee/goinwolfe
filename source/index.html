      <h1>How we fell in love:</h1>
      <h2>Her Story</h2>
      <p>Daniel and I were friends for several months before he first asked me out&mdash;although to be technical about it, it was really the second time. </p>
      <p>The first time, he invited me to a gallery opening and when I declined (I was on a backpacking trip with a friend), he enthusiastically asked if we could
        chat about my trip over drinks. I agreed, nervous but excited about the prospect of a date with Daniel. Unfortunately, it turned out ​he was just interested
         in being friends at that point. </p>
       <p>We continued seeing each other around DC, and once we discovered our mutual love of cooking and hosting dinner parties, we saw each other more often. Over
          the next few months we shared many meals and bottles of wine, and finally, after I was thoroughly confused about the status of our friendship, he asked me
          to dinner on an official date. A year later we moved to California! </p>
      <hr/>
      <h2>His Story</h2>
      <p>Woah woah woah. First of all, I couldn't tell if Dana was even interested in drinks when we met up! The ​real ​story is: out one night at a work happy hour,
        I found myself losing track of time chatting with Dana over cooking, politics, and ​life in DC when we were separated at the ends of a long table. ​​I was trying
        to engage in the conversations with those around me, but I looked across the table ​and heard Dana's ​charming laughter while her friends leaned in​ ​to ​hear the
        story​ she was telling​.</p>
      <p>I wanted to be sitting with her. I was falling for Dana. Asking her out on a date then seemed to high stakes! I knew how I felt and I
        feared rejection. Thankfully, one fateful​ night I hosted a​ Pho ​dinner party and finally​ asked Dana to a proper night out.</p>
      <p>Not too long after, holding her hand while we drove across the country, we knew we made the right decision.</p>

      <p>Since Dana's days ​as an undergraduate ​studying at Berkeley​​, she's enjoyed the fresh fruit and veggies from   <a href="http://fullbellyfarm.com/" target="_blank">Full Belly Farm</a>.
        W​hen we moved to California, we started receiving a CSA from Full Belly together&mdash;and when we visited the farm for the first time and​ realized we could
        rent their barn, we knew it was just right for our wedding. </p>
        <p>We'll be exchanging vows in the seclusion of the farm's walnut orchard. Then ​the party will begin back at​ the​ barn ​with drinks​, appetizers,​ and lawn games.
           The setting sun ​over​ the valley will play backdrop to a family style ​four course meal made with seasonal veggies. Late into an evening of dancing, we'll
           depart to camp under the stars.</p>

      <p>​We've reserved a block of rooms at the Fairfield Inn & Suites. ​The shuttles service will depart from the Fairfield Inn's
        parking lot​ at 2pm​. The Davis area has plenty of ​alternative ​accom​m​odations ​if you would like to stay in an AirBnB or another hotel​.
        We've listed some of our picks below.</p>
      <p>We will be spending the wedding night camping at the farm. If you're interested in camping as well please indicate so on your digital or paper RSVP.</p>
      <p>We also recommend that those flying in from out of town fly into the Sacramento Airport. This will be the closest airport to the venue. ​You can also
        fly into Oakland International Airport or San Francisco Airport, but please keep in mind that you will need to allow for roughly two hours of driving
        time to get to venue.</p>
