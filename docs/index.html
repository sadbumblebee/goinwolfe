      <h2>Her Story</h2>
      <p>When I couldn't make a gallery opening Daniel invited me to on account of a camping trip, he emailed me back&mdash;boldy, I thought&mdash;"that sounds like an
      adventure! let's chat about it over drinks when you're back in town." A date, great, I thought. Sad to say, though, Daniel strung me along ambiguous date after
      ambiguous date for the next four months. Once, he even grilled me fish, asparagus, and we polished off a bottle of Sauv Blanc before he put me in a cab home! Thankfully,
      he finally mustered the courage and took me out, <em>sans</em> vaguery.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h2>His Story</h2>
      <p>OK. OK. First of all, I couldn't tell if Dana was even interested in drinks when we met up! The story is: out one night at a work happy hour, I found myself losing
      track of time chatting with Dana over cooking, politics, and the uptight DC atmosphere when we were separated at the ends of a long table. Sat between conversation I
      could barely stand, I looked across the table hearing Dana's enamouring laughter while her friend's leaned in to her story.</p>
      <p> I fell for her then and knew I wanted to be seated with from her from then on. Asking her out on a date then seemed to high stakes! I knew how I felt and I feared rejection. Thankfully, one fateful Pho party night
      I asked Dana to a proper night out.</p>
      <p> Not too long after, holding her hand while we drove across the country, we knew we made the right decision.</p>

      <p>Since Dana's days studying at Berkeley, she's enjoyed the fresh fruit and veggies from
        <a href="http://fullbellyfarm.com/" target="_blank">Full Belly Farm</a>.
        Every wednesday we pick up our CSA from up the street. And nearly every morning, Dana's on
        <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BeRf8MWBF64/?hl=en&taken-by=full_belly_farm" target="_blank">Instagram</a>
        looking at pictures any number of the farm's baby goats, chickens, or cows. When we realized we could rent their
        new barn for our wedding, we didn't hesitate.</p>
      <p>We'll be exchanging vows in the seclusion of the farm's walnut orchard. Then we'll join the party back at
        barn for drinks and lawn games. The setting sun on the valley will play backdrop to a family style three course
        meal made with seasonal veggies. Late into an evening of dancing, we'll depart to camp under the stars.</p>

      <p>For your convenience we've reserved a block  of 16 rooms at the Fairfield Inn & Suites. Not coincidentally, the shuttles service
      will depart from the Fairfield Inn's parking lot. The Davis area has plenty of accomodations to fit any need. We've listed some of
      our picks below.</p>
      <p>We will be spending the wedding night camping at the farm. If you're interested in camping as well please indicate so on your digital
      or paper RSVP.</p>
      <p>We also recommend that those flying in from out of town fly into the Sacramento Airport. This will be the closest airport to the
      venue. Alternatively you may fly into Oakland International Airport or San Francisco Airport, but please keep in mind that you will
      need to allow for roughly two hours of driving time to get to venue.</p>
